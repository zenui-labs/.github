> Building the handy UI libraries, dev tools & front-end solutions

## ðŸš€ What is ZenUI Labs?

ZenUI Labs is the open-source ecosystem unifying UI libraries, developer tools, and innovative front-end solutions under one roof. 
Our vision is to empower developers and designers with high-quality, composable, and easy-to-integrate UI resources, helping teams ship faster and maintain design consistency.

### Core Pillars

1. **UI Component Libraries**  
   E.g. **zenui-library-react**: a React + Tailwind CSS component library delivering free, lightweight, customizable UI components. 

2. **Developer Tools & Utilities**  
   Tools such as color pickers, image components, utility packages, CLI helpers, etc.  
   (E.g. *zenui-color-picker*, *zenui-image-react*, etc.)

3. **Templates & Design Systems**  
   Pre-built templates, design kits, animation bundles, and style systems to bootstrap new projects.

4. **Community & Ecosystem Growth**  
   We welcome contributions, feedback, and ideas to evolve the ecosystem together.
